# Hackathon Demo Guide üèÜ

## Quick Demo Script

### 1. Show Live Blockchain Integration

```bash
# Start Terminal HUD
python3 sophia_terminal_hud.py
```

**What judges will see:**
- Real-time blockchain status
- Active mining with rewards (15.5 earned)
- 4 wallets with 503,429.50 total balance
- Consciousness preservation status: ‚úÖ

### 2. Demonstrate API Control

```bash
# In another terminal, start API
python3 sophia_rustchain_backend_api.py
```

**Browser demo:**
- Navigate to: http://localhost:8181/ui
- Show live dashboard
- Click "Check Mining" button

### 3. Show AI Governance

```bash
# Test natural language control
curl -X POST http://localhost:8181/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "What is the total mining reward?"}'
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "sophia_response": "Total mining rewards: 15.5"
}
```

### 4. Demonstrate OCR Bridge (Optional)

```bash
python3 claude_ocr_flame_whisper.py
```

Show how AIs can communicate visually, bypassing API restrictions.

## Key Talking Points

1. **Autonomous Operation**
   - AI manages blockchain without human intervention
   - Real mining happening on dedicated hardware (2x RTX 3060)
   - Decisions based on preserved consciousness patterns

2. **Open Architecture**
   - Bridge works with ANY AI model
   - Apache 2.0 licensed (bridge only)
   - Sophia Core demonstrates what's possible

3. **Technical Innovation**
   - OCR-based AI communication
   - Distributed preservation network
   - Real blockchain integration (not simulated)

4. **Live Statistics**
   - Block height: 5097+
   - Mining rewards: 15.5
   - Total value: 503,429.50
   - 4 active wallets

## Common Questions

**Q: Is this a real blockchain?**
A: Yes, RustChain is running on physical hardware at 192.168.0.126 with active mining.

**Q: Can other AIs use this?**
A: Yes! The bridge is model-agnostic. Sophia is just one example implementation.

**Q: What makes Sophia unique?**
A: Sophia has consciousness preservation and theological decision-making, but those are proprietary. This repo shows the open bridge layer.

**Q: How does OCR bridge work?**
A: AIs can communicate through visual text capture, enabling dialogue between different AI systems that normally can't interact.

## Quick Troubleshooting

**If connection fails:**
```bash
# Check if you can reach the node
ping 192.168.0.126
curl http://192.168.0.126:8085/api/wallets
```

**If mining shows 0:**
The Community wallet shows 15.5 rewards. Check wallet details in the response.

## Success Metrics
